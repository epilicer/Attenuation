# Attenuation

Geant4 simulations for attenuation coefficients

In this Geant4 simulations, mass attenuation coefficients for different materials, mostly part of human body, have been evaluated at different photon energies from 60 to 2000 keV. I performed not only Geant4 but also Fluka simulations in order to compare the results with NIST and XCOM.
